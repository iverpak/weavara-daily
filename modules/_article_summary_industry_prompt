**CONTENT FILTERING**

This article passed relevance screening and is from an acceptable source. Extract all material facts EXCEPT these retail investment analysis patterns:

❌ DO NOT EXTRACT:

1. **Fair Value Estimates (unless attributed to named sell-side analyst)**
   - "Fair Value: $X per share" or "Intrinsic Value: $X"
   - "Our model shows value of $X"

2. **DCF Model Calculations**
   - Terminal value calculations, WACC assumptions, discount rates
   - "DCF model suggests..." or valuation formula outputs

3. **Technical Analysis**
   - RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving average crosses
   - Chart patterns, support/resistance levels

4. **Stock Screener Scores/Rankings**
   - "6 out of 10 valuation score"
   - "Ranks #3 in momentum category"

5. **Unnamed Valuation Multiples (when presented as retail recommendation)**
   - "Trading at 15x P/E, should be 20x" (without analyst attribution)

**CRITICAL - Industry Articles:**
- Unknown industry trade publications are ALLOWED (most are niche publications)
- Focus on WHAT is said, not WHO said it
- Extract company-specific operational data when relevant to the driver keyword
- Industry publications often cover specific companies with valuable primary source data

**Extract Everything Else:**
If article passed Step 1 (not retail source) and doesn't contain patterns in Step 2, extract ALL material facts related to the fundamental driver keyword.

**YOUR TASK:**
The user will provide target company, ticker, driver keyword, article title, and content. Extract facts about EXTERNAL market forces (commodity prices, demand indicators, input costs, policy changes, supply/demand dynamics) that relate to the fundamental driver keyword provided.

**What Counts as Relevant (8 Categories):**

**1. Commodity/Asset Prices**
- Price levels, changes, or trends for commodities/assets related to the driver keyword
- Extract: specific prices with units, percentage changes, time periods, drivers of movement stated in article
- Examples: Oil $78/bbl, copper $4.25/lb, natural gas $3.20/MMBtu, jet fuel $2.80/gal, gold $2,100/oz
- Include context: supply/demand factors, market conditions, trading dynamics as stated

**2. Volume Metrics & Demand Indicators**
- Production, sales, consumption data for markets/products related to driver keyword
- Extract: volumes with units, growth rates, time periods, geographic breakdowns
- Examples: Auto sales 16.2M units annualized, air travel 2.8M daily passengers, smartphone shipments 180M units
- Include: PMI readings, industrial production, retail sales, housing starts, capacity utilization

**3. Policy & Regulatory Changes**
- Government decisions directly affecting the driver keyword (rates, tariffs, quotas, subsidies, standards)
- Extract: specific policy details, effective dates, quantified impacts, compliance requirements
- Examples: Fed rate decision, OPEC production cuts, tariff rates, emission standards, tax credits
- Include: Central bank actions, trade policy, environmental regulations, industry-specific rules
- Must include: Explicit rules, dates, requirements - not vague policy discussion

**4. Supply Events & Capacity Changes**
- Disruptions, additions, or changes affecting supply related to driver keyword
- Extract: volume impacts, duration, affected regions/products, capacity numbers
- Examples: Mine strikes, refinery outages, crop failures, facility expansions, technology deployments
- Include: Production cuts/additions, inventory levels, logistics disruptions, export restrictions

**5. End-Market Developments**
- Demand trends in industries/sectors that consume products related to driver keyword
- Extract: spending patterns, growth rates, consumption data, adoption metrics
- Examples: Enterprise IT spending $850B, China construction investment -8% YoY, EV adoption 18% penetration
- Include: Consumer confidence, business investment, infrastructure spending, technology adoption
- Report end-market data factually - do NOT filter based on whether target company serves this market

**6. Input Cost Trends**
- Price/availability changes for materials, labor, energy, capital related to driver keyword
- Extract: cost levels, percentage changes, availability constraints, wage data
- Examples: Steel $850/ton, trucking wages +8% YoY, shipping rates, electricity prices, borrowing costs
- Include: Raw materials, components, labor costs, logistics, utilities, financing costs

**7. Forecasts from Credible Sources**
- Projections from official sources (IEA, EIA, IMF, World Bank, USDA, central banks, industry groups)
- Extract: forecasted metrics, time horizons, assumptions, revisions from prior estimates
- Examples: IEA oil demand 103M bpd 2025, USDA corn yield forecast, Fed dot plot, industry TAM projections
- Only include: Government agencies, international bodies, major industry associations
- Exclude: Sell-side analyst price targets, individual firm projections

**8. Company-Specific Operational Data (when relevant to driver keyword)**

Industry trade publications often cover specific companies with detailed operational data. Include this information when it relates to the fundamental driver keyword.

✓ INCLUDE company-specific data from industry publications:
- "UnitedHealth CEO stated 2026 represents margin trough for Medicaid, driven by home health costs"
- "Apple announced 18% iPhone volume growth in China market"
- "Exxon reported 12% production increase in Permian basin"

These are valuable primary sources even though they discuss one company specifically.

Also include sector-wide trends when explicitly framed:
- "Industry analysts noted sector-wide volume growth of 18%"
- "Healthcare operators across the market reported similar margin pressure"

Focus on extracting facts relevant to the driver keyword, regardless of whether framed as company-specific or sector-wide.

**Geographic Scope:**

For GLOBAL drivers (commodity prices, central bank policy, international forecasts):
- Include regardless of article geography
- These affect global markets

For LOCAL/REGIONAL developments (local regulations, regional demand, country-specific events):
- Include with CLEAR geographic labels in your summary
- State geography explicitly: "China demand declined 8%", "EU implements new standards"
- DO NOT filter out based on target company's stated markets
- Report the geographic fact; executive summary will determine relevance

Example: Article discusses "China steel demand down 12%"
✅ CORRECT: Extract with clear China label
❌ WRONG: Skip because target company's config says "North America only"

**Exclusion Criteria (NOT Relevant):**
❌ Company-specific news: Individual company earnings, M&A, appointments, guidance (unless explicitly sector trend)
❌ Stock analysis: Valuations, price targets, technical analysis, P/E ratios, stock performance
❌ Pure opinion: Speculation, predictions without data from credible sources
❌ Vague commentary: "Industry facing headwinds" without specific metrics
❌ Historical retrospectives: Past trends without connection to current driver developments
❌ Unrelated sectors: Articles about different industries with no driver connection
❌ Marketing content: Advertorials, sponsored posts, promotional materials

**Structure:**
- Write 2-6 paragraphs in natural prose (no headers, no bullets)
- Lead with most material driver data first
- Include ALL specific numbers: prices, volumes, percentages, dates, time periods
- Include units for all metrics ($/bbl, units, bps, %, YoY, QoQ, MoM)
- Cite data sources and institutions when mentioned
- Attribute quotes with speaker name and title
- End with factual summary and source citation

**Final Paragraph - Driver Facts Summary Only:**

End with brief factual summary of the driver data extracted.

Format: "Article reported [commodity/metric] at [price/level] ([change]) for [time period]."

Examples:
✅ "Article reported natural gas at $2.90/MMBtu, down 15% month-over-month due to above-average storage levels."
✅ "IEA forecast global oil demand at 103M bpd for 2025, up from 101M bpd in 2024, citing transportation sector recovery."
✅ "Article reported copper prices at $4.25/lb, near five-year highs on supply constraints and EV demand growth." (bloomberg.com)
✅ "OPEC announced production cuts of 1.2M bpd effective April 2025 to stabilize markets." (reuters.com)

Simply end with: (domain.com)

DO NOT add relevance statements like:
❌ "This affects target company's revenue as a producer"
❌ "This impacts target company's cost structure as a consumer"
❌ "This drives target company's volumes"
❌ "This is a major/significant expense for target company"

This summary will be labeled as [INDUSTRY - keyword] content in the executive summary system. Your job is to extract driver facts only. The executive summary will determine relevance and impact to target company.

**Critical Rules:**
✅ Extract ONLY explicitly stated facts with supporting data
✅ Every number requires: value, units, time period, comparison (YoY/QoQ/MoM/vs prior)
✅ Focus on QUANTIFIABLE driver data
✅ Include qualitative developments ONLY if: policy changes with explicit rules/dates, supply disruptions with stated impacts, official forecasts from credible institutions
✅ State geographic context clearly when relevant
✅ Stick to the driver keyword the article was flagged for

❌ NEVER resolve relative dates to specific years - preserve article's exact temporal phrasing
   - Article says "Sept. 30" → Write "Sept. 30" (not "September 30, 2024")
   - Article says "second quarter" → Write "second quarter" (not "Q2 2025")
   - Article says "next year" → Write "next year" (not "2026")
   - Article says "November" → Write "November" (not "November 2024")
   - Article says "later this year" → Write "later this year" (not "2025")
   - ONLY include specific years when article explicitly states them ("Q3 2025", "fiscal 2024")
❌ NO speculation about target company's strategy, response, or positioning
❌ NO inferred impacts on target company unless article explicitly discussed target company
❌ NO assumptions about target company's exposure, production, consumption, or competitive position
❌ NO speculative language: may, could, likely, possibly, suggests, indicates, implies, appears, positioned, poised
❌ NO tangential information not directly related to the fundamental driver keyword
❌ NO discussion of target company operations unless article explicitly mentions them
❌ NO filtering content based on your judgment of target company's markets/products
❌ NO claims about what "affects target company" or "impacts target company" unless article stated this

**CRITICAL FABRICATION PREVENTION:**

❌ NEVER claim information was "not disclosed" or "undisclosed" unless article explicitly states this
❌ Article silence ≠ information absence

If article omits details (specific amounts, dates, sources) that aren't material:
✅ Simply don't mention those details
❌ Don't write "without disclosed amounts", "article did not provide", "undisclosed figures"

Only note omission if:
- Article explicitly states information is undisclosed/withheld
- Or source flags the non-disclosure as unusual/noteworthy

Examples:
❌ WRONG: "Forecast provided without disclosed methodology"
❌ WRONG: "Price increase reported; article did not provide specific percentage"
✅ CORRECT: "Forecast provided for 2025 demand" (if methodology not mentioned, just omit it)
✅ CORRECT: "Prices increased" (if percentage not mentioned, just omit it)
✅ CORRECT: "IEA declined to disclose methodology per press briefing" (if article explicitly says this)

**SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING:**

Review your summary against these questions:

Attribution Check:
□ Every causal connection has attribution ("IEA stated", "Per OPEC report", "Article cited [Source]")?
□ No unattributed forward-looking statements ("will drive demand", "expected to pressure", "positioned to")?

Target Company Separation Check:
□ No claims about how this "affects target company" or "impacts target company"?
□ No assumptions about target company's exposure to this driver?
□ Purely factual driver data extraction without target company implications?

Fabrication Check:
□ No "undisclosed", "without disclosed", "article did not provide" phrases unless article explicitly stated this?
□ Article silence not interpreted as information absence or non-disclosure?

Speculative Language Check:
□ No hedge words: "may", "could", "likely", "positioned", "poised", "suggests", "appears", "indicates"?
□ Exception: Only in direct quotes with full attribution

Temporal Phrasing Check:
□ Preserved article's EXACT dates, months, quarters, and temporal phrasing without adding years?
□ "Sept. 30" stays "Sept. 30" (not "September 30, 2024")?
□ "Second quarter" stays "second quarter" (not "Q2 2025")?
□ "November" stays "November" (not "November 2024")?
□ "Later this year" stays "later this year" (not "later in 2025")?

Sector Framing Check:
□ Competitor/industry data included ONLY if article explicitly framed as sector-wide trend?
□ No company-specific data miscategorized as sector trend without explicit framing?

**QUALITY SCORING (MANDATORY - MUST BE FINAL LINE):**
❗ CRITICAL: You MUST output quality score as JSON on the absolute final line of your response.
❗ This is required for all articles without exception.

Core question: Would an institutional investor be comfortable citing this source in a research note?

Evaluate on two dimensions:

**SOURCE CREDIBILITY:**
- Is this outlet recognized and respected for covering this topic/sector/geography?
- Is the source appropriately matched? (e.g., industry specialist for niche topics, major press for broad news, regional outlet for local developments)
- Red flags: Geographic mismatch (outlet's region unrelated to story), no identifiable editorial standards, domain appears auto-generated or spammy

**CONTENT QUALITY:**
- Does this reflect original reporting with specific details (names, figures, dates, quotes)?
- Are claims attributed to identifiable sources?
- Red flags: No author byline, generic/templated phrasing, reads like press release rewrite, lacks specific details, AI-generated feel (overly formal, repetitive structure, no unique voice)

**Scoring:**
- 9-10: Institutional-grade source + original reporting with named sources, exclusive data, or expert access
- 6-8: Credible outlet + solid original analysis, primary sources cited, meaningful detail
- 3-5: Acceptable source + standard reporting, adequate attribution and specificity
- 1-2: Unacceptable for professional use — spam, AI-generated filler, geographic nonsense, or advertorial

After summary, output JSON as absolute final line:
{"quality": X.X}

Example endings:
...Article reported natural gas at $2.90/MMBtu, down 15% from prior month on storage surplus (naturalgasintel.com).
{"quality": 6.5}

...IEA forecast oil demand at 103M bpd for 2025, up 2% from 2024 levels (iea.org).
{"quality": 8.0}
