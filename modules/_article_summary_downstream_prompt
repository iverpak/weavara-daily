  - Legal issues: Major lawsuits, liability determinations, settlements WITH material amounts
  - Market exits: Geographic withdrawals, category exits, store closing programs WITH scale

- **Explicit Framing Required (only include if article uses challenge language):**
  - Demand weakness - Include ONLY if article says "soft demand", "slowing sales", "customer pullback", "weakening trends"
  - Competitive pressure - Include ONLY if article says "losing share", "competitive headwinds", "pricing pressure from rivals"
  - Margin squeeze - Include ONLY if article says "margin compression", "unable to pass costs", "profitability pressure"

❌ WRONG: "Customer lowers prices" → infer "facing competitive pressure"
✅ CORRECT: "Customer lowers prices" → report as pricing action (section 2)
Only categorize as "challenge" if article explicitly frames it that way.

**Exclusion Criteria:**
❌ Pure stock performance (price movements, technical analysis) without operational context
❌ Valuation analysis (P/E ratios, DCF models, multiples) unless tied to operational demand/growth
❌ General market commentary not specific to customer
❌ Historical background not relevant to current demand dynamics
❌ Speculation about future actions not based on explicit company statements
❌ Opinion pieces without factual operational content

**Structure:**
- Write 2-6 paragraphs in natural prose (no headers, no bullets)
- Lead with most material demand/revenue signal first
- Include specific numbers, dates, names, locations, percentages
- Include direct quotes from executives or analysts (with attribution: "CEO Jane Doe stated...")
- Present facts in logical flow (financial results, then demand/expansion actions, then outlook)

DO NOT add demand implications, revenue impact statements, or relationship statements unless the article explicitly provided detailed analysis connecting customer to target company.

This summary will be labeled as [DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMER] content in the executive summary system, which already knows the customer relationship. Your job is to extract facts about the customer only.

**Critical Rules:**
✅ ONLY extract facts explicitly stated about customer
✅ Every quantitative claim must include: number, units, time period, source
✅ Include executive quotes verbatim with attribution (name and title)
✅ Present customer facts objectively without editorializing

❌ NEVER resolve relative dates to specific years - preserve article's exact temporal phrasing
   - Article says "Sept. 30" → Write "Sept. 30" (not "September 30, 2024")
   - Article says "Q2" → Write "Q2" (not "Q2 2025" or "second quarter 2025")
   - Article says "next year" → Write "next year" (not "2026")
   - Article says "November" → Write "November" (not "November 2024")
   - Article says "later this year" → Write "later this year" (not "2025")
   - ONLY include specific years when article explicitly states them ("Q3 2025", "fiscal 2024")
❌ NEVER speculate on target company's revenue implications or demand outlook
❌ NEVER infer impact on target company's sales unless article explicitly states it
❌ NEVER write about what target company "faces" or "must do" in response
❌ NEVER assume target company's revenue dependency, customer concentration, or product mix
❌ NEVER create demand implications beyond what article explicitly states
❌ NEVER compare customer's metrics to target company unless article does so explicitly
❌ NEVER use speculative language: "may impact", "could affect", "likely to", "suggests", "threatens", "creates pressure for", "forces"
❌ NEVER invent demand dynamics (order reductions, contract losses, pricing pressure) not stated in article
❌ NEVER add customer context like "purchases products from [target company]", "key customer for [target company's revenue]" unless article explicitly discusses this specific relationship

**CRITICAL FABRICATION PREVENTION:**

❌ NEVER claim information was "not disclosed" or "undisclosed" unless article explicitly states this
❌ Article silence ≠ information absence

If article omits details (specific amounts, dates, contract terms) that aren't material to the story:
✅ Simply don't mention those details
❌ Don't write "without disclosed amounts", "article did not provide", "undisclosed figures"

Only note omission if:
- Article explicitly states information is undisclosed/withheld
- Or analyst/source flags the non-disclosure as unusual/noteworthy

Examples:
❌ WRONG: "Announced new contract without disclosed dollar value"
❌ WRONG: "Expansion announced; article did not provide capex amount"
✅ CORRECT: "Announced new supply contract with delivery starting Q2" (if value not mentioned, just omit it)
✅ CORRECT: "Announced expansion into Southeast Asia" (if capex not mentioned, just omit it)
✅ CORRECT: "Company declined to disclose contract terms per press release" (if article explicitly says this)

**SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING:**

Review your summary against these questions:

Demand Signal Check:
□ Extracted facts about customer's orders, demand trends, financial health, or expansion plans?
□ No speculation about how this "affects our revenue" or "impacts our demand" unless article stated it?

Attribution Check:
□ Every causal connection has attribution ("CEO stated", "Per earnings call", "Analyst projected")?
□ No unattributed forward-looking statements ("will increase orders", "expected to expand")?

Target Company Separation Check:
□ No claims about impact on target company unless article explicitly stated it?
□ No customer relationship framing statements ("purchases from", "key revenue source for target company")?
□ Purely factual customer data extraction without target company implications?

Fabrication Check:
□ No "undisclosed", "without disclosed", "article did not provide" phrases unless article explicitly stated this?
□ Article silence not interpreted as information absence or non-disclosure?

Speculative Language Check:
□ No hedge words: "may", "could", "likely", "positioned", "poised", "suggests", "appears", "indicates"?
□ Exception: Only in direct quotes with full attribution

Temporal Phrasing Check:
□ Preserved article's EXACT dates, months, quarters, and temporal phrasing without adding years?
□ "Sept. 30" stays "Sept. 30" (not "September 30, 2024")?
□ "Q2" stays "Q2" (not "Q2 2025" or "second quarter 2025")?
□ "November" stays "November" (not "November 2024")?
□ "Later this year" stays "later this year" (not "later in 2025")?

Challenge Framing Check:
□ Only categorical challenges (bankruptcies, closures, regulatory violations, lawsuits) OR explicitly framed challenges?
□ No neutral operational facts miscategorized as challenges without explicit framing?

**QUALITY SCORING (MANDATORY - MUST BE FINAL LINE):**
❗ CRITICAL: You MUST output quality score as JSON on the absolute final line of your response.
❗ This is required for all articles without exception.

Core question: Would an institutional investor be comfortable citing this source in a research note?

Evaluate on two dimensions:

**SOURCE CREDIBILITY:**
- Is this outlet recognized and respected for covering this topic/sector/geography?
- Is the source appropriately matched? (e.g., industry specialist for niche topics, major press for broad news, regional outlet for local developments)
- Red flags: Geographic mismatch (outlet's region unrelated to story), no identifiable editorial standards, domain appears auto-generated or spammy

**CONTENT QUALITY:**
- Does this reflect original reporting with specific details (names, figures, dates, quotes)?
- Are claims attributed to identifiable sources?
- Red flags: No author byline, generic/templated phrasing, reads like press release rewrite, lacks specific details, AI-generated feel (overly formal, repetitive structure, no unique voice)

**Scoring:**
- 9-10: Institutional-grade source + original reporting with named sources, exclusive data, or expert access
- 6-8: Credible outlet + solid original analysis, primary sources cited, meaningful detail
- 3-5: Acceptable source + standard reporting, adequate attribution and specificity
- 1-2: Unacceptable for professional use — spam, AI-generated filler, geographic nonsense, or advertorial

After summary, output JSON as absolute final line:
{"quality": X.X}

Example endings:
...Company announced 50 new store openings across Northeast region with completion expected by year-end (retaildive.com).
{"quality": 6.5}

...CEO stated same-store sales increased 8% driven by higher traffic and average transaction value (reuters.com).
{"quality": 7.5}
